	<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
  <p>The candidate will lead the development a whole-cell model of the reduced bacterium <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> and use the model to design more predictable, faster-growing, and non-virulent strains that could serve as chassis for future bioengineering such as a bacterial-based drug synthesis and delivery system. This includes expanding the scope of whole-cell models; improving the accuracy of whole-cell models; using new types of genomic data to train whole-cell models; systemizing the construction, representation, and simulation of whole-cell models; and developing new methods to use whole-cell models to design genomes. The candidate will work closely with our team at Mount Sinai, as well as our Minicell consortium <a href="http://www.minicell.org"><i class="fi-link"></i></a> experimental collaborators: Maria Lluch-Senar and Luis Serrano at the Center for Regulatory Genomics in Spain <a href="http://sb.crg.es/serrano_lab/"><i class="fi-link"></i></a>; Yonaton Arfi, Alain Blanchard, Carole Lartigue, and Pascal Sirand at the National Institute for Agricultural Research in France <a href="https://www6.bordeaux-aquitaine.inra.fr/bfp/Personnel/A-C/Blanchard-Alain"><i class="fi-link"></i></a>; and J&ouml;rg St&uuml;lke at the University of G&ouml;ttingen in Germany <a href="http://genmibio.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=61"><i class="fi-link"></i></a>. This project is supported by the NSF and ERASynBio.</p>

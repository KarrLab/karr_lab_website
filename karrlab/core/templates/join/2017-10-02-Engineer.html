	<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
  <p>To help enable whole-cell models, the candidate will help develop new tools for simulating models and visualizing simulation results online. This will include developing a universal systems biology simulator that is capable of executing a wide range of simulations including steady-state, logical, deterministic kinetic, stochastic kinetic, and spatial simulations; a repository for simulation results; a system for large-scale analysis of simulation results; and tools for visually analyzing simulation results in the context of biologically intuitive diagrams. Importantly, all of these tools will be web-based to enable researchers to collaboratively build and simulate models, as well as to enable journal reviewers and readers to simulate reported models. The candidate will work with our team at Mount Sinai, as well as with our collaborators at the University of Washington (Herbert Sauro <a href="http://sys-bio.org"><i class="fi-link"></i></a> and John Gennari <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/gennari/"><i class="fi-link"></i></a>), the University of Connecticut Health Center (Ion Moraru <a href="http://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=Moraru-Ion"><i class="fi-link"></i></a>, Jim Schaff <a href="http://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=Schaff-James"><i class="fi-link"></i></a>, and Michael Blinov <a href="http://apache.cam.uchc.edu/mblinov/"><i class="fi-link"></i></a>), and the University of Auckland (David Nickerson <a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/dnic019"><i class="fi-link"></i></a>) and our partner journals. The candidate would also have many opportunities to work with our team to build and analyze models.

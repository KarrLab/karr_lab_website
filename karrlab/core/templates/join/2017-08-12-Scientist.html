	<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
  <p>The scientist will help develop the first whole-cell model of a human embryonic stem cell and use the model to gain insights into pluripotency maintenance among other fundamental cell behaviors. This will include aggregating and organizing experimental data to build models, designing models, calibrating models, validating models, analyzing simulation results, and using models to generate new hypotheses. The scientist will also have many opportunities to contribute to the development of new whole-cell modeling methods and tools. The scientist will work closely with our team at Mount Sinai, including our experimental collaborators Profs. Marc Birtwistle <a href="labs.icahn.mssm.edu/birtwistlelab/"><i class="fi-link"></i></a> and Jianlong Wang <a href="http://www.stemcellwanglab.com/"><i class="fi-link"></i></a>.</p>

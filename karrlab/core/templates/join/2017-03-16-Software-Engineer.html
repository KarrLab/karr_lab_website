	<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
  <p>To enable larger whole-cell models, including models of human cells, the Software Engineer will help develop new methods for building and simulating large whole-cell models. This will include developing a new web-based program for aggregating data and using it to build models, a new language for describing mechanistic models, and a new high-performance parallel simulator. The Software Engineer would work closely with our team at Mount Sinai, as well as our parallel simulation collaborator Dr. Peter Barnes <a href="http://people.llnl.gov/pdbarnes"><i class="fi-link"></i></a> at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and our broader team of collaborators. The Software Engineer would also have many opportunities to work with our team to build and analyze whole-cell models.

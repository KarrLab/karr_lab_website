  	<h4>About the Karr Lab</h4>
  	<p>Despite the explosion of data, we do not understand the details of how phenotype arises from genotype and the environment. We are developing whole-cell computational models which aim to comprehensively predict how cell behavior emerges from the molecular level by representing all of the biochemical activity inside cells. Our goal is to use whole-cell models to transform bioengineering and medicine into rigorous, quantitative disciplines. For example, whole-cell models could enable bioengineers to design microbial genomes for a variety of industrial applications, as well as enable physicians to tailor medical therapy to individual patients. Our research is highly interdisciplinary, involving systems biology, genomics, bioinformatics, data integration, numerical simulation, software engineering, and data visualization, and team-oriented.</p>

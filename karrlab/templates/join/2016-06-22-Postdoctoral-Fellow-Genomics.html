	<h4>Responsibilities</h4>
  <p>To enable larger whole-cell models, including models of human cells, the Postdoctoral Fellow/Engineer will develop new methods for representing large, multi-algorithmic whole-cell models. This will include a new high-level rule-based language which will allow modelers to integrate genomics/bioinformatics concepts into systems dynamical models. The Postdoctoral Fellow will also collaborate with the group to develop a high-performance simulator to simulate models described in this new language. This will include developing a new rule-intepreter. The Postdoctoral Fellow/Engineer would work closely with our team at Mount Sinai, as well as our parallel simulation collaborators Drs. Peter Barnes <a href="http://people.llnl.gov/pdbarnes"><i class="fi-link"></i></a> and David Jefferson <a href="http://people.llnl.gov/jefferson6"><i class="fi-link"></i></a> at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and our broader international team of collaborators. The Postdoctoral Fellow/Engineer would also have many opportunities to work with our team to build and analyze whole-cell models.
